This directory contains pdf files of the results of the marine monitoring discovery work undertaken by MEDIN in 2025 to investigate whether there is a need for an online directory of marine monitoring. We recommend downloading the pdf so that you can zoom in and read the smaller print.

Each pdf represents a different persona and contains user stories of that persona. Blank post-it notes are intentionally included where needs were provided but no "so that I can" example was given by the respondee.
